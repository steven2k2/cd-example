# CI/CD pipeline


# CI/CD Features

## Artifacts

### Purpose
Artifact storage in the CI/CD pipeline ensures that essential outputs, such as build files or coverage reports, are retained after the workflow completes. This allows for better debugging, testing, and rollback capabilities.

### Implementation
The pipeline is configured to:
- **Store Coverage Reports:** Generated by Jest, these reports are uploaded and stored as artifacts for reviewing test coverage after the workflow runs.
- **Store Build Artifacts:** The production build of the React application is stored, enabling further testing or deployment to staging and production environments.

### Benefits
- **Debugging:** Developers can download and analyze stored artifacts to troubleshoot issues.
- **Testing:** Artifacts can be used in staging environments for QA validation.
- **Rollback:** Provides the ability to revert to a previous build if issues arise in production.

### Accessing Artifacts
Stored artifacts are available in the **Actions** tab of the GitHub repository. They are retained for 90 days by default and can be downloaded for local use or redeployment.

### Future Enhancements
- Automating artifact usage in staging environments.
- Configuring longer retention periods for critical builds.

| **Source Control Trigger** | ✅               | Workflow triggers on commits to the repository (e.g., `main` branch).       |
| **Automated Tests**        | ✅               | Jest tests run automatically, halting workflow on failures.                 |
| **Notifications**          | ✅               | Alerts configured for workflow status via GitHub Mobile.                    |
| **Automated Build**        | ✅               | The build process is integrated and runs as part of the CI workflow.        |
| **Deployment**             | ✅               | Deployment to GitHub Pages is automated post-build.                         |
| **Code Quality Checks**    | ✅               | ESLint integration for linting and static code analysis.                    |
| **Test Coverage Analysis** | ✅               | Jest generates coverage reports; coverage badges partially implemented.     |
| **Coverage Badges**        | ❌               | Automated.                                                                  |
| **Environment Separation** | ❌               | Staging and production workflows.                                           |
| **Artifact Storage**       | ❌               | Build artifacts stored in GitHub Actions.                                   |
| **Security Checks**        | ❌               | Security scans and audit checks.                                            |
| **Monitoring**             | ❌               | Monitoring and post-deployment validation configured.                       |
| **Containerisation**       | ❌               | Docker integrated into the pipeline.                                        |
