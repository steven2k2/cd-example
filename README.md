# CI/CD Pipeline Example

This repository demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline implementation using GitHub Actions. It is designed as a learning exercise to explore CI/CD concepts and their practical application in modern web development, specifically for a React project.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Source Control Trigger
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented
- **Description:** The pipeline is triggered automatically on commits to the `main` branch, ensuring a continuous integration workflow.

### 2. Automated Tests
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented
- **Description:** Jest is used for testing the project. Tests run automatically in the pipeline, and any failures halt the workflow to ensure code quality.

### 3. Notifications
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented
- **Description:** Notifications for workflow status are configured via GitHub Mobile, providing alerts for failures and successes.

### 4. Automated Build
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented
- **Description:** The build process is integrated into the pipeline and runs automatically as part of the CI workflow.

### 5. Deployment
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented
- **Description:** Deployment to GitHub Pages is automated post-build, allowing the application to be continuously delivered and available online.

### 6. Code Quality Checks
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented
- **Description:** ESLint has been integrated into the pipeline for linting and static code analysis, ensuring code adheres to best practices.

### 7. Test Coverage Analysis
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented
- **Description:** Jest is configured to generate coverage reports, helping to track test completeness for the application.

### 8. Artifact Storage
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented
- **Description:** Build artifacts, including test reports and coverage results, are stored in GitHub Actions for debugging and rollback purposes.

## Features In Progress or Pending

### 1. Coverage Badges
- **Status:** ❌ In Progress
- **Description:** Automating the creation of coverage badges to reflect test coverage in the `README` file.

### 2. Environment Separation
- **Status:** ❌ Pending
- **Description:** Setting up distinct workflows for staging and production environments to better manage deployments.

### 3. Security Checks
- **Status:** ❌ Pending
- **Description:** Adding security scans and audit checks to ensure the safety of dependencies and application code.

### 4. Monitoring
- **Status:** ❌ Pending
- **Description:** Implementing monitoring and post-deployment validation to ensure system stability and performance.

### 5. Containerization
- **Status:** ❌ Pending
- **Description:** Integrating Docker into the pipeline for standardized application environments.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the pipeline locally using `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` to replicate CI checks.
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages via the provided workflow.

## Future Goals

This project aims to serve as a complete example of a modern CI/CD pipeline by gradually implementing features like security scanning, monitoring, and Docker-based containerization.
